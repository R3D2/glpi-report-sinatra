## Description
In our company, we use GLPI has a tool to follow-up all incidents or request made by our clients. Each entity in GLPI

## Installation

### Database

Specify the right credentials to log into the GLPI database in the 'app.rb' file.

### Deploy
In our production environment we use Phusion passenger + apache, just follow the guidelines on the web. If you
want to use another web server feel free to remove the "config.ru" and the passenger gem from the dependencies.

In the public folder, you need to create a new folder called "tmp" and give write permissions. This folder is used
to generate the pdfs.

Keep in mind the program has been made with the objective of being deployed on a sub-folder /report at the root of the
 GLPI application. If you want to change that, you will need to change all the urls in the app.

## Usage

Select one or many entities, the time range and the status of the tickets you want to be displayed in the report and 
generate.

little help for non french speakers :
* r√©solu - resolved
* clos - closed

The look of the report can be easily changed by tweaking the 'report.erb' file.
